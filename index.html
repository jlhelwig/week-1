<h3>The cozy way to stay warm in Winter<h3>
<p>The Kotatsu, or heated table, is a design from Feudal Japan. A wooden framework was built over the subfloor fire, and a heavy blanket was drapped over the framework. The family would spend the evening hours with their legs under the blanket; warm, full and enjoying each other's company.<p>
<p>As cozy as it is, the Kotatsu is also a great way to save money and energy through the winter months. As a bonus, if you have pets, you will always know where they are...under the warm Kotatsu.</p>
